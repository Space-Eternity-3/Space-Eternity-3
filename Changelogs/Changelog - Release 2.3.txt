- It is now possible to customize target_packet_frequency value in server config.

Technical changes:

- Anti-aliasing increased from x4 to x8 on ultra (default) settings.
- Reworked impulse shield system and added potion shield system.
- Reworked storage material system to automatically generate item materials.
- Treasure string format updated to handle treasure bases.
- Settings format changed to fit quality settings.
- Asteroids with ID 14 and 15 are stone_clone and copper_clone from now, with properly assigned drill_loot for them.
- Reworked dynamic object movement smoothing (spaceships, bosses, bullets), which resulted in much better performance.
- Player rotation is now locked using Rigidbody component and not through script, as it was before.
- Increased target packet frequency value 25 -> 60, which results in more accurate entity position calculations (server side).
- Path to saves directory is now set independently from game directory, which means, that direct downloading is possible from now.
- Textures are rendered using trilinear mode instead of bilinear from now.
- Item textures rendering improved.
- Inventory moves more smoothly from now.
- Give command code slightly improved to handle impossible give counts.
- Boss bullet collision system ignores non-structural asteroids from now to increase performance.
- Asteroids generate spiraly from now, which prioritizes asteroids near player.
- 5 generated asteroids per frame reduced to 2 to increase performance.
- Structures will generate in parts from now, which (at least in theory) reduces spike lag during loading.

Bug fixes:

- Impulse "god-mode" is no longer possible through cheats.
- SND_fire sound (for fire and wind bullets) had some weird artefacts at the end.
- Error texture in storages was magnetic alien instead of particle texture.
- Respawn had a broken behaviour while holding mouse both over UI and over it.
- It was possible to highlight storages and even activate a boss while not alive.
- Server could rarely enter the broken loop state when it was starting, which was causing majority of the update code to not execute.
- Other players' respawns weren't visible when player wasn't living.
- Fixed bug, which was sometimes causing unexpected player movements.
- Background texture was generating mipmaps, which was causing it to have worse quality on lower resolutions.
- Some velocity modifiers could affect static impulse velocity, for example geyzers or adecodron spikes.
- Camera could sometimes shake after player death.
- UI wasn't disappearing instantly after entering pause menu.
- Diodes on vanishing asteroids could sometimes cause some weird visual bugs.
