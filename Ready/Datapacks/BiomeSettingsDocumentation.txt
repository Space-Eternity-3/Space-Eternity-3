1. Biome settings are used to customize biomes
and default generation

2. Biome settings variable look:

settings: [
	tag1,
	tag2,
	tag3,
	tag4,
];

3. Datapack will be always imported, even if some tags are incorrect,
so put them precisely.

4. Tags might have a parameter for example density=5% and it is
called {} in this documentation.

5. All tag list:

a) min={A}, max={B}
Use them to set a minimum and maximum biome radius.
Picked number will be random between these 2 parameters.
Parameters are integers <0;80>
Default: [min=65, max=80]

b) radius={C}
Use it to set biome radius precisely.
Parameter is an integer <0;80>
Default: [min=65, max=80]

c) density={D}
Use it to set how often asteroids will appear.
Parameter is a percent integer <0%;100%>
0% means no asteroids.
Default: [density=60%]

d) ring={E}
Use it to set an asteroid ring around a biome.
Parameter sets a wideness of the ring.
Parameter is an integer <0;80>
Incompatible with "hole={F}"
Default: [NOT USED]

e) hole={F}
Use it to set a generation hole in the middle of
a biome. Parameter sets a radius of the hole.
Parameter is an integer <0;80>
Incompatible with "ring={E}"
Default: [NOT USED]

f) priority={G}
Use it to show which biome will
generate at the end and overwrite
others, when they touch each other.
No biomes will be removed.
Parameter is an integer <1;31>
Default: [priority=16]

g) grid
Use it to disable asteroid offset and see
a beauty of the asteroid grid generator
Default: [NOT USED]

h) full
Use it to make a 300x300 biome square.
Sometimes it might be overwriten by other
biomes, but you can always set a high
priority to prevent it.
Default: [NOT USED]

i) structural
Use it to disable touching other biomes with this tag.
It automatically sets priority to 32 (bigger than max)
Biomes with this tag have double generation points.
That means, they engage 2 times more space in a biome
generation array because of technical reasons.
Do not use it, when it is not necessarily!
Default: [NOT USED]

j) arena
Use it to generate arena in the middle of a biome.
Tag "structural" is required to work. It is also recommended
to use tag "hole={F}" or "ring={E}" and set a minimum biome
radius to at least 40
Default: [NOT USED]
